Questions:
    Explain the differences between Java and JavaScript. You should include both topics related to the fact that Java is
    a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language, and general differences in language features.

1)
    På trods af egennavnet JavaScript både inkluderer ordet Java og Script i sit navn så har JavaScript
    ikke noget med nogen af delene at gøre.

    Lad mig citerer fra bogen "You don't know JS" "Scope & Closures" af Kyle Simpson:

        Side 1 -- Compiler Theory
        It may be self-evident, or it may be surprising, depending on your level of interaction with various languages,
        but despite the fact that JavaScript falls under the general category of "dynamic" or "interpreted" languages,
        it is in fact a complied language. It is not complied well in advance, as are many traditionally complied languages,
        nor are the results of compilation portable among various distributed systems.

    Altså: Java og JavaScript er begge kompilerede computer sprog.

    Features forskelle:

    Java er klassebaseret                   JavaScript er prototype-baseret
    Java uses block-based scoping           JavaScript uses function-based scoping.
